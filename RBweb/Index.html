                    In the social network Twitter, trending topics (TT) are the main keywords or hashtags that are discussed among its Twitter users in real time and that form a list of trends that usually includes about 20 concepts.
                    These trends are an effective and easy way to see what the current issues are in the world or in a certain area and who is talking about them.
                    The trending topic or topic of the moment is a word, a phrase or a topic that is mentioned in the social network at a higher rate than others.
                    These topical topics become popular in a short time, either spontaneously, through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts people to talk about this specific topic.
                    The topics covered in this aspect help Twitter and its users to understand what is happening in the world and what people’s opinions are about it.
                    Sometimes they are the result of strategies agreed by a group of users and also manipulations carried out by actors linked to the political scene and, on a more playful level, of teenage fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, in particular musicians or films.
                    Twitter has modified the trending algorithm in the past to prevent such manipulation, with limited success.

                        are going on in the manufacturing process for creating flexible, efficient and sustainable production lines.
                         5G is the key enabler for this shift. 5G technology offers the manufacturers the opportunity to take advantage
                        of automation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IOT). 
                        Using private and public 5G networks, manufacturers can link systems inside the factory to supply chain,
                        distribution warehousing and customer service. </p>

                <span class="post-date" >9 sep 2022</span>
                <p class="post-description">
                    While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades,
                    John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 127 KB) (link resides outside IBM), 
                    " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence,
                    but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."
                    However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (PDF, 92 KB) (link resides outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the following question, "Can machines think?"  From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test", where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish,
                    it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics.</p>
